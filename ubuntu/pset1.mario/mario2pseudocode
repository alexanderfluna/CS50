Lines 7-10: Prompt user for height (answer)

Line 12: If height is not an integer between 1 and 8, reprompt user for height (answer)
Assume below that the answer is 8:

Line 14:
1) Start *int row* at 0
2) Check the conditiion is 0 less than 8
3) If 0 is less than 8, do the for loops below

Lines 16-18:
1) Start *int space* at 7 = *answer(8)* minus 1.
2) Check the condition is 7 > *row(0)* minus 1 = -1
2) Since 7 > -1, print 7 spaces until 0 > -1. This stops here because -1 is not > -1.
3) Since the condition is now false, go down to the next line

Lines 20-22:
1) Start *int hashes* at 0
2) Check the condition is 0 < *row(0)* plus 1 = 1
3) Since 0 < 1, print 1 hash. This stops here because 1 is not > 1.
4) Since the condition is now false, go down to the next line

Line 25:
1) Now that the other for loops are done, print out '\n'
2) Go back to the top of the for loop because *int row* did not process 8 times yet

Line 14:
1) *int row* added 1 so it's now 1
2) Check the condition is 1 less than 8
3) If 1 is less than 8, do the for loops below

Lines 16-18:
1) Start *int space* at 7 = *answer(8)* minus 1
2) Check the condition is 7 > *row(1)* minus 1 = 0
2) Since 7 > 0, print 6 spaces until 1 > 0. This stops here because 0 is not > 0.
3) Since the condition is now false, go down to the next line

Lines 20-22:
1) *int hashes* added 1 so it's now 1
2) Check the condition is 1 < *row(1)* plus 1 = 2
3) Since 1 < 2, print a hashmark because it started as 1 and another hashmark because the condition is true. This stops here because 2 is not < 2
4) Since the condition is now false, go down to the next line
